Overview of Python and Version HistoryÂ¶
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Since then, Python has evolved through various versions, with each version introducing new features, improvements, and bug fixes.

Version History:
Python 1.0 (1994): The initial release of Python included core features like functions, modules, exception handling, and data types such as lists and dictionaries.

Python 2.0 (2000): Introduced list comprehensions, garbage collection, and support for Unicode. Python 2.x series continued with updates until Python 2.7, which reached end-of-life in 2020.

Python 3.0 (2008): A major overhaul of the language to address various inconsistencies and introduce new features. Notably, it replaced the print statement with the print() function, introduced Unicode as the default string type, and made several syntax changes for better consistency and clarity.

Python 3.x Series: Since Python 3.0, the language has continued to evolve with regular releases, introducing features like type annotations, async/await syntax for asynchronous programming, f-strings for string formatting, and more.

Latest Version: As of February 2024, the latest stable version of Python is Python 3.10.x, which includes new syntax features, performance improvements, and library updates.
